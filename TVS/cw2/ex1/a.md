### Exercise 1

**a) Compare Figure 5-17 with Figure 5-18. The change from 4-level mapping to 5-level mapping increases the maximum size of virtual address spaces. Calculate the maximum size for each case.**

----

**4-level mapping**

In 4-level mapping, the maximum amount of bits that can be used to index memory is 48 (from bit 47 down to bit 0). This means that the maximum size for the virtual address space can be calculated by:

(2^48) = (2^8) * (2⁴40) = 256T addresses.


**5-level mapping**

In 5-level mapping, the maximum amount of bits that can be used to index memory is 57 (from bit 56 down to bit 0). This means that the maximum size for the virtual address space can be calculated by:

(2^57) = (2^7) * (2⁴50) = 128P addresses.
